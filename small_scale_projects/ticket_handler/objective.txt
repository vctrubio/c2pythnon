Goal is to use pony/or sqlmodel, fastapi, postgress and (frontend?react?)

pony to connect to the db - postgress
fastapi to crud operations
frontend = react to have good UI (this is last)
relationship ticket>:user

ticket>: has one user
user<: has many tickets


#UserStory
    -create tickets with name and price
    -each ticket has one user
    -group tickets in the ui, which should effect the db
